Pride comes before a fall!
Winners never quit. Quitters never win.

Aha! Git 1:
	Use git status -s to see the status of the files. If it shows AM, then it means that it has been modified since it was last added. So, if we commit right now, then we would be adding the file as it was when it was added, notthe way it is right now. So always do "git add" before committing

Aha! Git 2:.

git diff : 
	Shows what code or content we have changed since the last commit that are not yet staged for the next commit snapshot.
